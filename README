AI Gym - Web Application

AI Gym is developed using python framework Django. Django is a popular web framework for Python that is designed to help developers build web applications quickly and efficiently. It provides a high-level framework for web development, including a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, built-in security features, and a customizable admin interface.

Other major packages includes OpenCV, pandas, mediapipe. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of computer vision and machine learning algorithms developed by Intel. It is widely used for real-time image and video processing, object detection and tracking, facial recognition, and more.

OpenCV provides a Python interface that allows developers to easily use its functionalities in their Python applications. Here are some of the basic steps to use OpenCV in Python:


MediaPipe is a cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines. It provides easy-to-use Python APIs for building real-time computer vision, audio, and sensor-based applications. One of the key features of MediaPipe is its pre-built, customizable pipelines for common perception tasks like object detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, face detection and tracking, and more.
