<H4>Health Risks of Overweight & Obesity</h4>

    <p>
        Type 2 diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. About 8 out of 10 people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or have obesity.8 Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, eye problems, nerve damage, and other health problems.

If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes, losing 5 to 7 percent of your body weight and getting regular physical activity may prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.

        Heart disease is a term used to describe several problems that may affect your heart. If you have heart disease, you may have a heart attack, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, angina NIH external link, or an abnormal heart rhythm. High blood pressure, abnormal levels of blood fats, and high blood glucose levels may raise your risk for heart disease. Blood fats, also called blood lipids, include HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

Losing 5 to 10 percent of your weight may lower your risk factors for developing heart disease. If you weigh 200 pounds, this means losing as little as 10 pounds. Weight loss may improve blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood flow.

        Stroke is a condition in which the blood supply to your brain is suddenly cut off, caused by a blockage or the bursting of a blood vessel in your brain or neck. A stroke can damage brain tissue and make you unable to speak or move parts of your body. High blood pressure is the leading cause of strokes.

    <h3>Remedies</h3>
    <h5>Eating & Physical Activity to Lose or Maintain Weight</h5>
    <p>
        Changing your eating habits is central to losing and maintaining your weight. To lose weight, you have to eat fewer calories and use more calories than you take in. This can be challenging for many people to do for an extended period of time. Emerging research shows that sticking with an eating plan may be more important to losing and maintaining weight than the type of eating plan you follow.

        Follow a healthy eating plan
        All your food and beverage choices count. Eating healthy is a journey shaped by many factors, including your age, weight, metabolism, food preferences, access to food, culture, and traditions; whether you are a man or woman; and the personal decisions you make over time. A healthy eating plan includes
        
        a variety of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, such as brown rice, oats, and whole-wheat bread
        fat-free or low-fat dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese and similar products such as soy beverages
        a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, and soy products
        oils, such as olive and canola oils and those found in nuts, olives, and avocados
        A healthy eating plan also includes
        
        consuming fewer foods and beverages that have refined carbohydrates, added sugars, and salt (sodium)
        controlling portion sizes
        limiting foods with saturated fats and trans fats, like those found in desserts and fried foods

    <h3>Food Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    If you are overweight, it's important to focus on eating a healthy, balanced diet that provides you with the nutrients you need while also helping you manage your weight. Here are some food recommendations that can help you achieve this:

Choose nutrient-dense foods: Focus on eating whole, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods provide your body with the nutrients it needs without contributing excessive calories.

Eat plenty of fiber: High-fiber foods such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can help you feel full and satisfied, which can help prevent overeating.

Limit processed and high-sugar foods: Foods that are high in added sugars, fats, and calories, such as sugary drinks, candy, and baked goods, can contribute to weight gain.

Choose lean proteins: Choose lean sources of protein such as chicken, turkey, fish, legumes, and low-fat dairy products.

Monitor portion sizes: Pay attention to portion sizes and try to eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day. This can help you feel full and prevent overeating.

Drink plenty of water: Drinking water can help you stay hydrated and feel full, which can help prevent overeating.

Remember that achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is a long-term process that requires a commitment to making healthy lifestyle choices. It's important to focus on making sustainable changes to your diet and exercise habits rather than relying on quick fixes or fad diets. If you have specific dietary needs or concerns, it's best to consult with a registered dietitian or healthcare professional who can provide personalized recommendations.
